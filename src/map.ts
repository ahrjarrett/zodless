 * 
 * {@link map `map`} takes two arguments:
 * 1. a function
 * 2. a composite data structure that contains zero or more targets to apply the function to
 * 
 * A unique feature of this implementation is its polymorphism: it doesn't are whether the
 * composite data structure is an array, or whether it's an object. It will apply the argument
 * to each of the children, and will preserve the structure of the original shape.
 * 
 * **Trade-off:** the data-last overload of {@link map `map`} is optimized for function composition. 
 * It works best when used inside a call to {@link fn.pipe `fn.pipe`} or {@link fn.flow `fn.flow`}.
 * It comes with greater potential for code re-use, at the cost of slightly slower performance.
 * 
 * **Ergonomics:** if you'd prefer to provide both arguments at the same time, see overload #2.

/**

 *
 * {@link map `map`} is a polymorphic function that accepts a function and a data structure (such 
 * as an array or object) to apply the function to.
 * 
 * A unique feature of this implementation is its ability to abstract away the type of the data 
 * structure it maps the function over; whether you pass it an object or an array, it will handle 
 * applying the function to the data strucuture's values and returning a data structure whose type 
 * corresponds 1-1 with the type of input.
 * 
 * **Trade-off:** the data-first overload of {@link map `map`} is evaluates eagerly. It comes with 
 * slightly better performance than the data-last overload, at the cost of reusability.
 * 
 * **Ergonomics:** if you'd prefer to use {@link map `map`} in a pipeline, see overload #1.
